## About Podcaster

**Podcaster** was created by me, Nathan Bottomley, a Latin teacher and podcaster living in Sydney, Australia. You can find out more about me [on my personal website][].

[on my personal website]: https://gunsandfrocks.com/about

You can contact me on [Bluesky][] or on [Mastodon][], or on the [**Podcaster** GitHub page][github].

**Podcaster** is based on code I wrote as I created [a series of podcast websites][] over a few years. It doesn't solve any very complex problems, but I needed to extract all the duplicate podcast-related code from my various podcast websites and put it somewhere so I could include it in all of them.

I hope you find it useful. [Let me know if you do](https://bsky.app/profile/nathanbottomley.com).

## Colophon

I've tried to follow the principles of technical documentation outlined by Daniele Procida in [_Diátaxis_](https://diataxis.fr).

This site was made using [Eleventy][], specifically the [eleventy-base-blog][] starter. The syntax highlighting on the code samples is courtesy of [Prism.js][], and the site's colour scheme is based on the [Base2Tone Pool][] theme by Bram de Haan.
