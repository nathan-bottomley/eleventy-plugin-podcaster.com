## About **Podcaster**

**Podcaster** was created by me, Nathan Bottomley, a Latin teacher and podcaster living in Sydney, Australia. You can find out more about me [on my personal website][].

[on my personal website]: https://gunsandfrocks.com/about

You can contact me on [Bluesky][] or on [Mastodon][], or on the [**Podcaster** GitHub page][github].

**Podcaster** is based on code I wrote as I created [a series of podcast websites][] over a few years. It doesn't solve any very complex problems, but I needed to extract all the duplicate podcast-related code from my various podcast websites and put somewhere where all of them could access it.

I hope you find it useful. [Let me know if you do](https://bsky.app/profile/nathanbottomley.com).
